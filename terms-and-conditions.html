      <p class="body-legal">End user license Agreement
        Version 1.2 - March 2016</p>
      <h1 class="title-legal">1. The Product and acceptance of terms</h1>
      <p class="body-legal">Welcome to UX Map (the Product), a toolkit for user
        interface design documentation created by Luca Benazzi.
          </p>
      <p class="body-legal">Your use of UX Map is subject to this license
        agreement. By using UX Map, you accept the terms and conditions of this license
        agreement including without limitation all prices and payment terms, as well as
        the privacy policy.</p>
      <p class="body-legal">Please read the terms and conditions carefully before
        you purchase a license to use UX Map. Use of UX Map implies that anyone (individual or entity, inclusive of affiliates and
        subsidiaries) who is assigned a license under the terms and conditions of this
        Agreement (each an &quot;Authorized
        User&quot;) accepts and agrees to be bound to these Terms.</p>
      <h1 class="title-legal">2. Description of service</h1>
      <p class="body-legal">UX Map is a package containing resources that can be
        used to enhance the design deliverables that you create with prototyping
        software Axure RP, and is delivered to you in the form of downloadable files.
        Specifically, these consist of widget libraries and template files. Make sure you have a valid license of the software
        required to use this material (Axure RP version 7.0 or higher). As a collection
        of icons from the Font Awesome collection was used, it is recommended that you also
        download and install the font at http://fontawesome.io, if it is not already
        installed on your machine.</p>
      <h1 class="title-legal">3.
        Intellectual property</h1>
      <p class="body-legal">This Agreement only confers upon you a license of use
        to UX Map (&quot;License&quot;). This license does not convey to you any rights
        of ownership in or to UX Map. When
        purchasing a license of use you acknowledge that the ownership of UX Map
        remains with Luca Benazzi. This includes the site www.ux-map.com and its
        original content, features and functionality, and the packages that can be
        downloaded by purchasing a License.</p>
      <p class="body-legal">Technical measures have been also implemented to
        prevent illegal copying or distribution of the Product. UX Map is protected by
        international copyright and trademark law.</p>
      <h1 class="title-legal">4. Grant of
        License</h1>
      <p class="body-legal">Luca Benazzi grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive,
        non-transferable, License to use UX Map for your purposes, in accordance with
        this Agreement.</p>
      <p class="body-legal">Each License is uniquely associated with one user.
        Companies or organisations willing to have a larger number of authorized users
        have to purchase a multiple license. 
        Multiple users using a single License will be flagged and their License
        may be subject to termination. </p>
      <p class="body-legal">To the extent a company or
        organisation have acquired multiple Licenses, they are allowed to distribute
        the UX Map to the agreed number of Authorized Users (employee, contractor or
        consultant) within the same company or organisation.</p>
      <p class="body-legal">A Company or organization can
        reassign their license within their employees, contractors or consultants for
        use solely on behalf of the same company or organisation, in the event that (a)
        the prior named user is no longer working for the above mentioned company or
        organisation, or (b) the prior named user has changed roles and has no intent
        to use the UX Map in the new role.</p>
      <h1 class="title-legal">5. Authorized User Rights</h1>
      <p class="body-legal">You can acquire a License of use against a one-time
        fee paid to Luca Benazzi as stated on the website at the time of purchase. </p>
      <p class="body-legal">You may modify the resources
        according to your requirements. For example, you may include UX Map resources
        in a prototype you will be designing for yourself or for your clients. You are
        not required to attribute the authorship or link to Luca Benazzi in a project.
        Luca Benazzi will not be responsible for any outcome that may occur due to
        usage of UX Map. </p>
      <p class="body-legal">You must at all times: (a)
        ensure that only an Authorized User may use the Product and only in accordance
        with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (b) promptly advise Luca
        Benazzi, including in writing, if you become aware of any unauthorized use or distribution
        of the Product by any person.</p>
      <h1 class="title-legal">6. Luca Benazzi Obligations</h1>
